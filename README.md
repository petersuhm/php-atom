# PHP Atom client

From [RFC 4287](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287):

> Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related
> information known as "feeds".  Feeds are composed of a number of
> items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
> metadata.  For example, each entry has a title.

> The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web
> content such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as
> directly to user agents.
