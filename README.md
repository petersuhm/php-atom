# PHP Atom client

From [RFC 4287](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287):

   Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related
   information known as "feeds".  Feeds are composed of a number of
   items, known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
   metadata.  For example, each entry has a title.

   The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web
   content such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as
   directly to user agents.
